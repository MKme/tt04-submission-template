#  8 Bit Digital Zipher
Simple cipher using 8 bit IO 

## The Idea
8 bit input. One combination opens the lock and powers the output. 255 combinations do not. 

Imagine this project has been done to death but this will be my first ASIC. 

## The reason

I want to support the tinytapeout initiative and also spread the knowledge on how to make fun projects and learn new skills. Having made ones' own IC is quite cool. 



# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip!

Go to https://tinytapeout.com for instructions!

## How to change the Wokwi project

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and change the wokwi_id to match your project.

## How to enable the GitHub actions to build the ASIC files

Please see the instructions for:

- [Enabling GitHub Actions](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#when-i-commit-my-change-the-gds-action-isnt-running)
- [Enabling GitHub Pages](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#my-github-action-is-failing-on-the-pages-part)

## How does it work?

When you edit the info.yaml to choose a different ID, the [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/gds.yaml) will fetch the digital netlist of your design from Wokwi.

After that, the action uses the open source ASIC tool called [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/) to build the files needed to fabricate an ASIC.

## What next?

- Submit your design to the next shuttle [on the website](https://tinytapeout.com/#submit-your-design), the closing date is 8th September.
- Share your GDS on Twitter, tag it [#tinytapeout](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tinytapeout?src=hashtag_click) and [link me](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn)!
